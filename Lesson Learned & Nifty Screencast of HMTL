## Lesson Learned:
NEVER TOUCH ANYTHING IN THE FIGURE-HTML DIRECTORY
If you remove a file from that directory - then Knitr gets really really upset - specifically pandoc gets really upset with a pandoc document conversion error.
So was never able to rename all the figures in the { r } brackets to nice names instead of unknown chunks.

Tried reinstalling knit2html to see if it would help after upgrade to 3.0.3 and the package is not available.
